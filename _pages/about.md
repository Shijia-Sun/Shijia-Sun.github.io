## My personal website is still under construction

I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Optics track at University of Science and Technology of China in 2022, and get the offer to Ph.D. program at UC Berkeley in 2022 Fall with full funding package. 

My reseach interest is AMO (Atomic, molecular and optical) Physics. To be more precise, I am especially interested in trapped ions, cold hybrid ion-atom systems, cold atoms and molecules. I have excellent academic performance, solid foundation of physics courses and abundant research experience. 

Due to force majeure problems (unexpected and tortured for me), I deferred my offer and am expected to enroll in UC Berkeley in 2023 Fall. Currently, I am continue learning the AMO knowledge and doing research in USTC (about fiber cavity) and remotely in UC Berkeley (about rotating ions).

In my spare time, I like reading classical novel and hiking. My favorite sports includes boxing, swimming and skiing.
